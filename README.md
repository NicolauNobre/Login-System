> Status: Developing ⚠️

This project is the first that i will develop and this has the pourpose to be the beggining of my journey where my focus is to grow everyday a little bit like a very good programer.

There's nothing too much complex on this project, it's just an login inspired on the facebook login page. I know that's not too beautiful but i'm not a designer 😅.

If someone doesn't have registered yet, so they can create an account on my ficticious website and it will be saved on an database (thats the plan, i don't guarantee nothing 😬.
